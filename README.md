# CK.HomeAutomation
A fully featured home automation solution which runs on a RaspberryPi 2 using Windows 10 IoT. It provides virtual actuators, a WebApp and is able to publish state information to an Microsoft Azure EventHub.

The physical actuators (relays for outputs, port expanders for inputs) are connected using the I2C bus.

The repository also includes the configuration for my home and can be used as a sample. It is also possible to create other configurations.
